# Sokoban Game

This game is part of the Conclusion Project of a Computer Engineering course.

It uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a version of a famous game called Sokoban, where the player needs to push boxs to the goals.

### JavaScript Modules
The project uses JavaScript Modules to organize and separate the classes and, to minimize the number of HTTP requests, it counts with **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)**. 

For more information on that, follow [this tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/bundle-static-site-webpack/).

### Web Server
A web server was implemented to make it available to access the game without the project downloaded.
